		<div class="bio">
			<p>My name is Austin Hendricks. I am a university student in Ohio who is currently taking a Web Applications project course through my school.</p>
			<p>However, that course is moving at an incredibly fast pace, so I have come to Coursera to help supplement my learning. This is my very first taste of web programming!</p>
			<p>I am an aspiring computer scientist looking to graduate college in May of 2023. I love everything related to cybersecurity and computer netoworking, and hope to enter into one of those fields!</p>
			<p>If you've somehow stumbled upon this page, lucky you! You've found my very first website. Hopefully there will be several more where this came from in the future.</p>
